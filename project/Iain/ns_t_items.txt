His extensive study in Frankfurt, Rome and Paris made him well aware of the way modern figure painting depended on copying Roman sculpture. His paintings of the 1870s resemble classical sculptures, with perfect nudes, precise outlines and rhetorical poses.This is the earlier of his only two life-size sculptures, both made with the assistance of Thomas Brock. In subject and scale it is evidently intended as a challenge to one of the greatest classical sculptures, The Laocoön, showing three men being crushed by two sea serpents.

She worked closely with Gilbert on the project, and became infatuated with him. Their relationship was passionate and intense, which shows in Gilbert's bust of her, with its ecstatic pose and writhing putti. The back of the bust is inscribed in Latin 'Alas! The fleeting years glide by!' Their friendship was broken off in 1907 after Eliza quarrelled with Gilbert about the length of time he was taking over her husband's monument, and she broke all the windows of his studio. She gave this bust to the gallery in 1915.

These also can hardly have been made outdoors, for Turner seems to have entered into the very spray and surge of the breakers as they crash on the shore. Rather he is recreating the experience of his walks on the sands, from memory and, perhaps, inspired by the movement of paint itself. Even if not painted within the elements they describe, few of his oil sketches convey more sense of the open air. 	\N

It is the fifth in a series of Nocturnes, produced during the 1870s. Whistler's aim in these works was to convey a sense of the beauty and tranquility of the Thames by night. It was Frederick Leyland who first used the name 'nocturne' to describe these moonlit scenes, suggesting the concept of evening, or night, but with musical associations.	\N
4622	PA	Iain	Harmony in Grey and Green: Miss Cicely Alexander	\N	Painting	\N	Aesthetic Movement	\N	\N	15912608.8626	2014-10-25	1872	Iain	Cicely Alexander was the daughter of W.C. Alexander, a successful London banker. She was eight years old when Whistler painted this portrait. Alexander may have been introduced to Whistler through their mutual interest in Oriental art - Alexander had a collection of Japanese lacquerwork and blue and white china - and Whistler adds a touch of Japonisme to the portrait through the gold-edged black dado and wall divider, and the delicate daisies and butterflies. Whistler also painted Cicely's older sister, Agnes Mary (Tate N05964), and had planned to paint her first, but was suddenly inspired to paint the younger girl in the dress and pose of Manet's Lola de Valence (1862, Musée d'Orsay). He gave strict instructions as to how Cicely should be clothed, designing the dress in detail and even giving directions as to where suitable fine Indian muslin material could be found. Even the black-and-white carpet on which she stands was made to order, by the sisters of the artist Walter Greaves (1846-1930). The finished work not only pays tribute to Manet but, through its loose brushwork and tonal handling of paint, also draws on the work of Velasquez, who had portrayed members of the Spanish court in similar poses and colouring.	\N
3280	PA	Iain	Past and Present, No. 3	\N	Painting	\N	Victorian	\N	\N	80476703.0730	2014-10-25	1858	Iain	This is the third of a set of three modern-life pictures on the theme of the fallen woman. They are typical of the social moralist pictures that were popular in Victorian art. The theme of the triptych is the discovery of the woman's infidelity and its consequences. In the first scene the family are still together, and the husband has just learned of his wife's adultery. The second scene takes place five years later. The father has recently died and the mother has been driven out of her home, a fallen woman. The two orphaned girls comfort each other, the elder gazing sadly over the rooftops towards the moon. In this third picture the moon occupies the same position in the sky, indicating that the scene is taking place at the same time. The children's mother, now destitute, has taken refuge under one of the Adelphi arches, described by the Art Journal as 'the lowest of all the profound deeps of human abandonment in this metropolis' (quoted in Wood, p.53). Under her shawl she shelters a young child, clearly the result of her adulterous affair, which is now over. Directly behind her a poster advertises two plays at the Haymarket Theatre, Victims and The Cure for Love; another announces 'Pleasure Excursions to Paris'. When the set of pictures was first shown at the Royal Academy in 1858, the drawing-room scene was hung between the other two. They were exhibited with no title, but with this subtitle, 'August the 4th - Have just heard that B - has been dead more than a fortnight, so his poor children have now lost both parents. I hear she was seen on Friday last near the Strand, evidently without a place to lay her head. What a fall hers has been!' Egg's pictures demonstrate how in Victorian England the full weight of the moral code fell upon women. A man could safely take a mistress without fear of recrimination, but for a woman to be unfaithful was an unforgivable crime. As Caroline Norton, an early feminist, wrote, 'the faults of women are visited as sins, the sins of men are not even visited as faults' (quoted in Lambourne, p.374).	\N

The other two panels, Guide of Childhood and Comfort of Old Age, are now lost. Together they echo prevailing views of woman's role in the Victorian home and reinforce the desired image of the 'fairer sex' as pure and submissive, as conveyed by Coventry Patmore in his popular poem 'The Angel in the House' (1854-63). The picture also anticipates John Ruskin's discussion of the relationships between men and women in his essay 'Of Queens' Gardens', from Sesame and Lilies (1865). Ruskin recommends that the education of girls should lead to 'true wifely subjection' on the part of 'her who was made to be the helpmate of man' (quoted in Lambourne, p.377).	\N

The first two in the series, Mariage de Convenance (1883, Glasgow Museums) and Mariage à la Mode - After! (1886, Aberdeen Art Gallery) depict the disadvantages of marrying for wealth rather than for love. The elderly husband is soon abandoned by his bored young wife. In The First Cloud, the marriage is still based on an exchange of her beauty for his wealth, but the age gap is less noticeable. However, without love, the relationship lacks any firm foundation, and this first rift between the couple is merely the cloud before the storm.	\N
1566	PA	Iain	Sympathy	\N	Painting	\N	Victorian	\N	\N	15582874.6158	2014-10-25	1878	Iain	Riviere achieved immense popularity with the Victorian public for his anecdotal and often humourous pictures of animals. 'Sympathy', showing a little girl sent in disgrace to sit on the stairs while being conforted by her dog, was among the most popular of all. The first version was shown at the Royal Academy in 1878, but the picture exhibited here is a study Riviere made for a second version. Always a supreme technician in his pictures, Riviere also painted historical subjects and portraits, but it was always his animal scenes to which the public most warmly responded. 	\N

The gardens were situated at the west end of Chelsea on the river, only a few hundred yards from Whistler's residence in Lindsey Row. They could be reached by foot or by steamboat, and offered a variety of entertainments, including restaurants, theatres, a 'stereorama', a gypsy grotto, a maze and an indoor bowling alley. In all his depictions of the gardens, Whistler ignored the dancing and music which were major features of the nightlife there and focused on the more mysterious and ephemeral activities, such as the nightly display of fireworks. Both this work and The Falling Rocket (1875, The Detroit Institute of Arts) show the climax of one of the pyrotechnic displays which were held every evening on the Cremorne fireworks platform, known as the Grotto. A crowd of spectators, their backs turned to us, are watching in awe the spectacular Catherine wheel as it revolves in the night sky, throwing off a shower of sparks. A tiered fountain strung with fairy lights is just visible to the left of the picture, with trees to left and right. 	\N

In Oxford, Rossetti saw Jane Burden, later Mrs William Morris, and immediately asked her to pose for him. She is the model for Princess Sabra, threading a lock of her hair through St George's helmet. The claustrophobic composition is characteristic of much of Rossetti's work at this time. Sabra's embrace of an armoured figure, enmeshing him with her hair, and St George's distracted gaze hint at Rossetti's dilemma of being involved with Elizabeth Siddall but feeling a strong attraction for Jane.	\N

He was well known for his compelling pictures of the urban poor, although he also painted less emotive scenes from everyday life, and portraits. The rich colouring, smooth handling of paint, and subject were probably inspired by the work of the seventeenth-century Spanish artist Murillo, who also painted poor children. 	\N

He returned to it over ten years later, in response to a commission from the 6th Duke of Bedford. This time he spent nearly two years working on a series of sketches to resolve the composition and gather details of the figures. However, when this picture was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1835, the critic of The Athenaeum described the finished painting as a 'hasty and happy' little picture.

This painting was based on a smaller one he exhibited in 1816 and which presumably was made on or after such a visit. Woodcutters at work or at rest appear in a number of his works from this period. Linnell was not able to devote much of his time to landscape, however, until the 1840s.

This view, painted south of Jerusalem, shows the Mount of Olives and the Garden of Gethsemane, the site of Christ’s anguish before the Crucifixion. The valley of Jehoshaphat was also believed to be where the Last Judgement would take place. Unlike John Martin’s apocalyptic visions, displayed nearby, Seddon represents the site in painstaking, sun-lit detail, paralleling the art critic John Ruskin’s remarks that ‘in following the steps of nature’, artists were ‘tracing the finger of God.’	'1854':13 'also':55 'anguish':46 'apocalypt':70 'art':86 'artist':99 'authent':17 'believ':56 'bring':15 'christ':44 'critic':87 'crucifixion':49 'detail':83 'display':72 'finger':103 'follow':94 'friend':4 'garden':38 'gethseman':40 'god':105 'greater':16 'holi':10 'holman':5 'hunt':6 'jehoshaphat':53 'jerusalem':30 'john':67,88 'journey':7 'judgement':62 'land':11 'last':61 'lit':82 'martin':68 'mount':33 'natur':98 'nearbi':73 'oliv':35 'painstak':79 'paint':27 'parallel':84 'place':65 'religi':23 'remark':91 'repres':75 'ruskin':89 'seddon':1,74 'show':31 'site':42,77 'south':28 'spiritu':18 'step':96 'sun':81 'sun-lit':80 'take':64 'topograph':20 'trace':101 'unlik':66 'valley':51 'view':26 'vision':71 'work':24 'would':63

Macbeth staggers forward, staring in horror, and still grasping the bloody daggers with which he has committed the deed. He tells his wife, 'I am afraid to think what I have done; Look on't again I dare not.' It is at this point in the play that Lady Macbeth seizes control. 'Infirm of purpose!' she responds to her husband, 'Give me the daggers.'

(The Annunciation)	\N	Painting	\N	Pre-Raphaelite	\N	\N	229721993.1364	1998-03-12	1849	Iain	Inspired by the work of early Renaissance artists such as Botticelli (1445-1510) and Fra Angelico (1387-1455), Rossetti sought in this work a radical reinterpretation of the Annunciation. Traditionally the Virgin was depicted in studious contemplation, reading a missal at a prie-dieu; but here Rossetti shows her rising awkwardly from a low bed, as if disturbed from sleep, while the Angel Gabriel presents her with a white lily. Both figures are dressed in white, a symbol of the virgin's purity, and the angel's role as the messenger of god is emphasised by the small white dove hovering beside him, signifying the presence of the holy spirit. Rossetti used several sitters for his figures, including his brother, William Michael, for the Angel and his sister, Christina, for the Virgin.

Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) recounted the story of his unrequited love and subsequent mourning for Beatrice Portinari in the Vita Nuova.

It shows various members of his family gathering shells. The artist’s interest in geology is shown by his careful recording of the flint-encrusted strata and eroded faces of the chalk cliffs.

The Pulleyne family has been forced to sell the ancestral home, Hardham Court, and its contents, thanks to the irresponsible behaviour of a feckless spendthrift. The picture contains a number of visual clues, which, when taken together, form an elaborate narrative. Family portraits and items of furniture bearing the initials of previous Pulleynes indicate that the family has a long pedigree. The miniature case in the father's hand and the sporting print in the left foreground tell us that he has gambled his inherited fortune away on the horses. Lot numbers have been attached to various items of furniture and works of art, and, together with the Christie's catalogue on the floor, reveal that the family's possessions are soon to be sold. In the background, a man is already gathering the objects that will be sent for auction. To the left of the picture, an old woman (probably the grandmother) is giving a five-pound note to the butler, who is clutching the keys to the house.

Shakespeare was a favourite source for Victorian painters, and the tragic-romantic figure of Ophelia from Hamlet was an especially popular subject, featuring regularly in Royal Academy exhibitions.

When shown at the Royal Academy in 1870, it was accompanied by a text of Millais's own invention which was printed in the exhibition catalogue: 'The order of Knights errant was instituted to protect widows and orphans, and to succour maidens in distress.' The moonlit scene apparently depicts an historic act of medieval chivalry in which one such Knight errant, clad in armour (based on examples that Millais had seen in the Tower of London), is on the point of freeing a woman who has been stripped and tied to a tree. The tree, a Silver Birch, was commonly identified with the female gender in the nineteenth century and was sometimes referred to as 'Lady Birch'. Birch twigs were also traditionally used in flagellation. The woman's clothes lie on the ground to the left and her molesters, assumed to be robbers by one critic, are seen fleeing the scene in the top right corner of the canvas. There is blood on the Knight's sword and the torso of a dead man is visible behind him.

She lives isolated in a tower on an island called Shalott, on a river which flows down from King Arthur's castle at Camelot. Not daring to look upon reality, she is allowed to see the outside world only through its reflection in a mirror. One day she glimpses the reflected image of the handsome knight Lancelot, and cannot resist looking at him directly. The mirror cracks from side to side, and she feels the curse come upon her. The punishment that follows results in her drifting in her boat downstream to Camelot 'singing her last song', but dying before she reaches there. Waterhouse shows her letting go the boat's chain, while staring at a crucifix placed in front of three guttering candles.

These profoundly influenced both artists, who set out to imitate their decorative design and subtle colouring. In addition, Moore’s admiration of ancient Greek sculpture is evident in his fascination with the rippled fabric of classical robes.Blossoms reflects these interests: the pose of the single female figure is like antique statues of Venus, while the delicate colouring and decorative background of flowers is an exercise in ‘Japonisme’.

After his death in 1227 during one of the Crusades, she entered a convent and devoted herself to good works. Before becoming a nun, she passed through a spiritual crisis, torn by the need to renounce the world, and therefore her children, in order to fulfil her desire to serve God. Pressed by a domineering monk, Conrad, whose natural affections had been starved by celibacy, Elizabeth finally vowed that 'naked and barefoot' she would follow her 'naked Lord'.

Led by the flamboyant Philip Hermogenes Calderon (1833-98), the group often rented Hever Castle in Kent during the summer months and used it as a setting for some of their pictures. Yeames and Frederick Goodall (1822-1904), another member of the clique, specialised in Tudor and Stuart subjects, but often departed from the tradition of depicting a particular specific historic event by creating situations which simply captured the mood of bygone times. Yeames' most famous picture is And when did you last see you father? (1878, Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), now a permanent waxwork tableau at Madame Tussaud's in London.

Mary Baldwin modelled for the woman at the gate. She was from Cookham Dean village and worked as the Clausen family’s nanny. Clausen was one of the ‘rural naturalists’, a young generation of predominantly French-trained painters who painted realistic scenes of everyday country life, in the late nineteenth century. Like others in this group Clausen was greatly influenced by the French painter Jules Bastien-Lepage, who painted in a similar style.

He began the picture while staying at the home of the painter F.D. Millet at Broadway, Worcestershire, shortly after his move to Britain from Paris. At first he used the Millets's five-year-old daughter Katharine as his model, but she was soon replaced by Polly and Dorothy (Dolly) Barnard, the daughters of the illustrator Frederick Barnard, because they had the exact haircolour Sargent was seeking. Dolly, aged eleven, is on the left; Polly, aged seven, is on the right. A sketchbook at the Fogg Museum, Cambridge, includes Sargent's outline designs for the painting, and two drawings at the Tate (Tate Gallery A00850-1) record the precise poses he required for the girls' profiles.

Traditionally the figure of Hope is identified by an anchor, but Watts was seeking a fresher, more original approach. He painted blind Hope seated on a globe and playing on a lyre which has all its strings broken except one. She bends her head to listen to the faint music, but her efforts appear forlorn; the overall atmosphere is one of sadness and desolation rather than hope. The picture's sense of melancholy is enhanced by the soft brushwork and the translucent mists that envelop the floating globe.

The subject of this picture is the release of one of these Jacobite rebels from prison. Millais appears to have invented the incident, but may also have been inspired by the novels of Sir Walter Scott, which provided a wealth material for artists and illustrators in the second half of the 19th Century. The rebel's wife, supporting their small child and comforting her exhausted, wounded husband, hands an order of release to the gaoler. The expression on her face is inscrutable. She appears strangely detached from the action, and the suggestion is that she may have been forced to sacrifice her virtue in order to save her husband. The picture's original title was The Ransom and early sketches reveal that Millais originally showed a purse of money being handed over. However, in the finished work he substitutes the order of release which gives the painting its current title. The signature on the document is clearly visible as that of Sir Hilgrove Turner, who encouraged Millais's artistic talent from an early age.

He is best known for a collection of poems, written in the name of Thomas Rowley, a 15th Century monk, which he copied onto parchment and passed off as mediaeval manuscripts. Having abandoned his first job working in a scrivener's office he struggled to earn a living as a poet. In June 1770 he moved to an attic room at 39 Brooke Street, where he lived on the verge of starvation until, in August of that year, at the age of only seventeen, he poisoned himself with arsenic. Condemned in his lifetime as a forger by influential figures such as the writer Horace Walpole (1717-97), he was later elevated to the status of tragic hero by the French poet Alfred de Vigny (1797-1863).

This picture is painted over an engraving of a work which Leslie exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1825. The subject comes from Shakespeare's play 'The Merry Wives of Windsor'.

Her career began around 1888, during which year she performed at a number of London music halls, including the Oxford, the Parthenon and Collins’, being described as a ‘youthful singer and dancer’.1 Owing to confusion with an American actress of the same name born in 1855 there has formerly been a belief that she was, when Sickert painted her, a middle-aged performer,2 adding an extra layer of irony and salaciousness to the songs she sang about herself in the character of an innocent schoolgirl. But, in fact, Cunningham was a young woman in her early twenties when Sickert met her in 1892, and was described by the poet Arthur Symons in a letter to a friend as ‘very pretty, very nice, very young’	'1':55 '1855':69 '1888':27 '1892':128 '2':88 'actress':62 'ad':89 'age':86 'american':61 'around':26 'arthur':135 'began':25 'belief':75 'birmingham':3 'born':1,67 'career':24 'charact':106 'collin':46 'comic':14 'confus':58 'cunningham':9,114 'dancer':17,54 'describ':48,131 'earli':121 'extra':91 'fact':113 'fig.1':22 'former':72 'friend':142 'hall':21,39 'includ':40 'innoc':109 'ironi':94 'layer':92 'letter':139 'london':37 'met':125 'middl':85 'middle-ag':84 'midland':7 'minni':8 'music':20,38 'name':66 'nice':147 'number':35 'owe':56 'oxford':42 'paint':81 'parthenon':44 'perform':32,87 'poet':134 'pretti':145 'salaci':96 'sang':101 'schoolgirl':110 'serio':13 'serio-com':12 'sickert':80,124 'singer':15,52 'song':99 'symon':136 'twenti':122 'west':6 'woman':118 'year':30 'young':117,149 'youth':51

At the first performance in 1888, Sargent was struck by Terry's appearance and persuaded her to sit for a portrait. He invented her dramatic pose, which did not occur in the production. Oscar Wilde, who saw Terry's arrival at Sargent's Chelsea studio, remarked, 'The street that on a wet and dreary morning has vouchsafed the vision of Lady Macbeth in full regalia magnificently seated in a four-wheeler can never again be as other streets: it must always be full of wonderful possibilities.'

Its inspiration was a verse from Proverbs: 'As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart'. With his typical thoroughness, Hunt hired a room at Woodbine Villa, 7 Alpha Place, St John's Wood, a 'maison de convenance', to use as the setting. A gentleman has installed his mistress (known to be such because of her absence of a wedding ring) in a house for their meetings. As they play and sing to Thomas Moore's Oft in the Stilly Night, she has a sudden spiritual revelation. Rising from her lover's lap, she gazes into the sunlit garden beyond, which is reflected in the mirror behind her. The mirror image represents the woman's lost innocence, but redemption, indicated by the ray of light in the foreground, is still possible. Intended to be 'read', the painting is full of such symbolic elements. The cat toying with the broken-winged bird under the table symbolises the woman's plight. A man's discarded glove warns that the likely fate of a cast-off mistress was prostitution. A tangled skein of yarn on the floor symbolises the web in which the girl is entrapped.

The title was suggested by a visitor to the artist's studio, Mrs Ralph Benson, and evokes Felix Mendelssohn's famous Songs without words, created for the piano between 1829 and 1845. In the picture, Leighton attempts to convey sound, or music, through paint. Sound is evoked by the blackbird at the top of the picture, which is shown in full song, and by the two fountains. One is high in the wall, with water gushing from a carved lion's head into a tank behind the seated girl; the other pours from the same tank into a tall black amphora.

The model is Alexa Wilding, who sat for some of Rossetti's best-known works, including La Ghirlandata (1873, Guildhall Art Gallery, Corporation of London) and The Blessed Damozel (1875-8, Fogg Museum of Art, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts). The spiral pearl clasp in her flowing auburn hair and the red coral necklace appear frequently in Rossetti's pictures of women. Along with the sweeping movement of her arms, the green rosettes on her shoulder and the floral earrings, they serve to accentuate the picture's circular composition. The heavily embroidered white and gold drapery is used in other pictures of this date, including Monna Rosa (untraced). The enormous sleeve recalls Raphael's portrait of Giovanna of Aragon in the Louvre.

He began to produce pictures which were almost entirely without subject, yet decorative and subtly coloured. Invariably they show women in classical robes, allowing him to concentrate on the colour, texture and movement of draped fabric.The Victorian poet Swinburne said such paintings are the ‘worship of things formally beautiful ... their reason for being is simply to be’.

He was more sympathetic to the NEAC Impressionists than most of the Newlyn artists, believing they 'are solving problems by making different compromises than ours'. His small-scale work is frequently reminiscent of Whistler and even Sickert. In 'Mount's and Tolcarne', painted in the open air, Garstin includes his wife and his daughter Alethea, who was to become a painter herself.

Generally the show received few reviews, and most of those focused on Philip Wilson Steer’s Mrs Cyprian Williams (Tate N04422). The Sunday Times noted of the exhibition that: “The present collection offers nothing to shock or amaze the average picture buyer.

Claudio's life can only be saved if his sister Isabella agrees to sacrifice her virginity to Angelo, the absent Duke's deputy. The moment is summed up by these lines from the play, which Hunt inscribed on the picture frame: 'Claudio. Death is a fearful thing. Isabella. And shamed life is hateful.' However, the painting is more than a mere illustration of Shakespeare's words, and Hunt conditions our response through the picture's subtle imagery.

On his return to England he earned a reputation for images of the Near East painted in watercolour or oils. Characterised by their bright colours and attention to detail, they often show languid figures, especially women in harems, who are often given western features.

These involved Turner in journeys in the summer of 1809 to gather material for these commissions. This material can be seen in the ‘Petworth’ (CIX) and ‘Cockermouth’ (CX) sketchbooks. In the former are a group of drawings of Cockermouth Castle; p. 24 shows a careful study for the oil and is much closer to the composition of the picture than the drawing on p. 14 which Finberg identifies as the sketch for it. There is also a related drawing on p. 16 of the ‘Cockermouth’ sketchbook among other views of the castle (in particular those on pp. 17 and 21). These drawings are much slighter and more rapidly executed than the detailed studies in the ‘Petworth’ sketchbook.

He deliberately made his pictures enigmatic and the meaning of this painting has provoked much debate. One view is that the eighteen women are spirits in an enchanted dream.

Sappho was born at Lesbos in about 612BC. After a period of exile in Sicily she returned to the island and was at the centre of a community of young women devoted to Aphrodite and the Muses. Although Solomon believed Erinna to have been part of this community, we now know that she lived not on Lesbos, but on the Dorian island of Télos, and slightly later than Sappho, at the end of the 4th Century BC. Sappho wrote nine books of poetry, of which only fragments survive. The principal subject of her work is the joy and frustration of love and the most complete surviving poem is an invocation to the goddess Aphrodite to help her in her relationship with a woman.

Palmer lived in Shoreham for about seven years. To him it represented a kind of rural paradise, an ideal landscape, touched by a divine presence. He called the Darent Valley the 'Valley of Vision'. Palmer's pictures of this period are intensely personal, and often have a mystical, even visionary quality comparable to the work of William Blake (1757-1827). Palmer was greatly inspired by Blake's illustrations to Ambrose Philips's imitation of Virgil's First Eclogue (1821) and could have been describing his own work when he wrote of the Blake engravings	'-1827':79 '1757':78 '1821':98 'ambros':89 'best':8 'best-known':7 'blake':77,85,112 'call':46 'compar':71 'could':100 'darent':48 'describ':103 'divin':43 'eclogu':97 'engrav':113 'even':68 'first':96 'great':82 'ideal':38 'illustr':87 'imit':92 'inspir':83 'intens':61 'kent':19 'kind':33 'known':9 'landscap':39 'live':15,21 'mystic':67 'often':64 'one':3 'paint':11 'palmer':5,20,54,80 'paradis':36 'period':59 'person':62 'philip':90 'pictur':56 'presenc':44 'qualiti':70 'repres':31 'rural':35 'seven':26 'shoreham':17,23 'touch':40 'valley':49,51 'virgil':94 'vision':53 'visionari':69 'william':76 'work':10,74,106 'wrote':109 'year':27

Typical of this period in Palmer's oeuvre, it represents a pastoral landscape: a shepherd and shepherdess tend their flock of sheep in the foreground, while harvesters gather up the glowing ripe corn in the fields and a crescent moon rises in the distance. The composition combines elements from the landscape around Shoreham, where Palmer was living, and the craggy shoreline of North Devon, which he had visited in 1834. The Devon scenery made an important impact on him, and, as his son, A.H. Palmer, later recalled, 'even before he had explored it, [it] seems to have commended itself to my father's affections, and afterwards became his ideal of English Scenery' (A.H.

Icarus, however, flew too near to the sun, the wax melted and he fell into the sea and drowned.

The artist wrote that 'at that time my whole thoughts were of my artistic equipment for the future [so] I conceived the idea that Perseus, before becoming a hero, was a mere mortal and that he had to look to his equipment'.

The first is the question of dating: the dates adopted here are highly tentative and are based on the supposition that there is a logical progression from a more substantial, three-dimensional style to one that is more impressionistic and less solid, together with a feeling that Turner's colouring was perhaps at its strongest from the early to the mid 1830s. However, as will be noted, the compilers do not always agree on even the tentative datings given here.

It is a portrait in medieval dress of Jane Burden, whom Morris married in April 1859. The picture has been identified in the past as Queen Guenevere, partly owing to the fact that Morris published his first volume of poetry, The Defence of Guenevere, in March 1858.

Turner, who bought a version of the picture in 1877: “The figure represents Proserpine as Empress of Hades. After she was conveyed by Pluto to his realm, and became his bride, her mother Ceres importuned Jupiter for her return to earth, and he was prevailed on to consent to this, provided only she had not partaken of any of the fruits of Hades. It was found, however, that she had eaten one grain of a pomegranate, and this enchained her to her new empire and destiny. She is represented in a gloomy corridor of her palace, with the fatal fruit in her hand. As she passes, a gleam strikes on the wall behind her form some inlet suddenly opened, and admitting for a moment the light of the upper world; and she glances furtively towards it, immersed in thought.” (W.

William Holman Hunt (1827-1910) describes a visit to Woolner’s studio earlier that year when the sculptor showed him Puck ‘with much paternal fondness’ (quoted in Read and Barnes, p.142). According to the catalogue accompanying the exhibition, Woolner was illustrating an incident from the ‘Imaginary Biography of Puck’: ‘As he was sailing through the air one day, searching for wherewith to please his humorous malice, right well was he satisfied to alight upon a mushroom and awaken a sleeping frog, of which a hungry snake was about to make a meal’ 	'-1910':30 '1827':29 '1847':25 'accompani':61 'accord':57 'air':81 'alight':98 'awaken':103 'barn':55 'biographi':72 'british':23 'catalogu':60 'day':83 'describ':31 'dream':17 'earlier':38 'exhibit':20,63 'fairi':8 'first':19 'fond':50 'frog':106 'holman':27 'humor':90 'hungri':110 'hunt':28 'illustr':66 'imaginari':71 'incid':68 'institut':24 'make':115 'malic':91 'meal':117 'midsumm':14 'much':48 'mushroom':101 'night':15 'one':82 'p.142':56 'patern':49 'plaster':2 'play':12 'pleas':88 'puck':5,46,74 'quot':51 'read':53 'right':92 'sail':78 'satisfi':96 'sculptor':43 'search':84 'shakespear':10 'show':44 'sleep':105 'snake':111 'statuett':3 'studio':37 'troublesom':7 'upon':99 'visit':33 'well':93 'wherewith':86 'william':26 'woolner':35,64 'year':40

After his return to England in 1884, he painted a series of luminous and brightly coloured scenes, often based around the beach, a location which can be linked with Monet's paintings of the same period. The loose brushwork and sparkling colours brilliantly capture the transience and exhilaration of childhood and summer vacations. His use of strongly contrasting colours draws on theories being promoted by the most avant-garde painters in France at this time.

The Darent valley appeared to Palmer a perfect, neo-Platonic world and he called it the 'Valley of Vision'. In this picture he creates an ideal image of pastoral contentment, unaffected by the outside world. The unseasonal combination of flowering horse-chestnut and huge ripe heads of wheat symbolise fertility and the richness of the soil, and Palmer may have been inspired by Edmund Spenser's lines from the Faërie Queene (1596), Book iii, Canto VI, beginning 'There is continuall spring, and harvest there'. The prominent church spire signifies a divine presence within the landscape. This is emphasised by the gothic arch created by the branches at the top of the composition, which relates closely to Coming from Evening Church (1830, Tate N03697). In the background, the characteristic rounded hills of Shoreham and the crescent moon, here shown on its back, were later adopted as motifs by artists of the mid-twentieth century. Inspired by John Milton's poetic evocations, the moon in its various phases became a recurring feature in Palmer's work.

He made a study of this motif on the spot, but would have refined and developed the image in the studio. Seurat aimed to place painting on a scientific basis in its treatment of light and colour and, using a style known as Divisionism, juxtaposed small brushstrokes of complementary colours to create a luminous effect in his works. He painted the border on the canvas, but the frame is much later in date.

This painting was based on a smaller one he exhibited in 1816 and which presumably was made on or after such a visit. Woodcutters at work or at rest appear in a number of his works from this period. Linnell was not able to devote much of his time to landscape, however, until the 1840s. Economic necessity forced him to be a portrait painter: 'portraits I painted to live,' he recalled, 'but I lived to paint poetical landscape'.

The pigments are vigorously worked; highlights have been created by scratching the paper. This picture is a good example of how some nineteenth-century watercolourists looked for ways of rivalling oil painting techniques. Lewis was one of the most successful painters in this style having started as an oil painter. Here, to the left, he has included a painting of a Venetian scene by R.P.Bonington: this shows Lewis paying homage to a brilliant artist who died when only twenty-six.

While an initial viewing might suggest a simple equestrian portrait, there is an implicit subtext of female domination in the woman’s mastery of the horse. Her determined expression, and the disparity between the horse and rider, reinforce this. Although never published in his lifetime, this design was used to illustrate Beardsley’s obituary in The Studio in 1898.
