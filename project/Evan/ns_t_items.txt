92619	armo	Evan	Corinthian Type Helmet	\N	\N	Armor	\N	Conflict	\N	102905	2013-05-29	-495	Clark Kent	"The Corinthian helmet type is one of the most immediately recognisable types of helmet, romantically associated with the great heroes of Ancient Greece, even by the Ancient Greeks themselves who rapidly moved to helmet types with better visibility, but still depicted their heroes in these helmets. In modern portrayals of Ancient Greek warriors, it is always the Corinthian type that is depicted, although often modified to suit the look desired - for instance in one movie the helmet was modified to expose more of the face of the actor. This specific helmet (ROM no.926.19.3) was purchased by the ROM in 1926 from T. Sutton of 2 Albemarle St., London, England, via Sotheby's (auction of 22 July 1926, lot 160). A skull (ROM No. 926.19.5) was said at one stage to be inside it, and in this condition was excavated by George Nugent-Grenville, 2nd Baron Nugent of Carlanstown, on the Plain of Marathon in 1834, according to letters from Sutton dated to 2 & 20 August 1826. Also a part of this lot, which sold for 80 pounds, was a helmet of ""Spartan type"" found by Nugent at Thermopylae in 1834 (ROM no. 926.19.4). Nugent (1788-1850) was High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands from 1832-5, but died without issue, and the Sutton letters state that the finds ""came by descent in the family into the possession of the Boileau family, and remained with them until they were sold to me (Sutton) by Lt. Col.R.F. Boileau of Ketteringham Park, Norfolk"". The Battle of Marathon of 490 BC is thought to be one of the most pivotal battles in history, as it was in this battle that the Greeks defeated the invading Persians, thereby enabling the development of the Greek Classical civilisation. Thermopylae, being a narrow pass, was the site of a number of battles, but Nugent would probably have been interested in finds from the battle of 480 BC,the battle in which the 300 Spartans (plus some other Greeks that people tend not to talk about so much) held the pass against the invading Persians. How reliable this attribution is we cannot be entirely sure, but Nugent would have been in Greece very shortly after its freedom following the Greek War of Independence (1821-1832) during which the British Navy had been very influential, so it is conceivable that a British antiquarian digging around these sites could indeed find these helmets at these important sites, and they are indeed of the types that would be used on these dates. As for the skull, it is difficult to be certain of the association. Since Marathon was a victory for the Greeks they would have been in a position to not leave any body parts or any useful equipment on the field, and the only damage to the helmet seems to be from age. So it is conceivable that it is just as unlikely that a helmet would be lost as much as the head that may have worn it, and we certainly have the helmet. I do not have any problem with the general idea of a helmet being found with a head still in it, as such things are found on battlefields, although typically not those of the victors. The alleged discovery of the object in 1834 seems sound, and Nugent may have been a romantic, but nothing in his biography would necessarily indicate a tale-spinner. However, 100 years passed between the finding of the object and our records, and we do not know how reliable may have been the transmission of information over that 100 years, perhaps especially since Nugent's house and contents were not inherited by his own children. Really, we cannot be certain that the skull belonged to the owner of the helmet, but really we cannot discount it, either. A DNA and radiocarbon study could tell us that it was a Greek of the time, but that is not presently planned."	\N
95516	bone	Evan	Plastered Human Skull	\N	\N	\N	\N	Ceremony	\N	2015432	1999-05-13	-8000	Owner	One of the most noteworthy cultural practices associated with the early Neolithic in the Near East, when people were first becoming village farmers, was the practice of removing skulls from dead bodies and saving them, sometimes elaborately decorating them. The focus on Neolithic skull removal and its interpretation as an aspect of ancestor veneration originated in the discovery of curated human skulls, and especially carefully plastered and decorated skulls, at the site of Jericho. Garstang found one example of a "decapitated" burial at Jericho in the 1930s, but concluded that it was the accidental result of post-burial earthquake activity. Kenyon famously found many headless burials as well as isolated and grouped skulls, sometimes carefully decorated with plaster and shell, at the same site in the 1950s. She specifically related these to ancestor veneration, the skull belonging to a "venerated member of the community whose wisdom it was hoped to perpetuate". Since then, the idea that the skulls represented ancestors, or even specifically male elders, has been very popular, despite the rather frequent discovery of skulls, even plastered skulls of young men, women and even children, some of whom were presumably no one?s ancestors. This requires a very generalized notion of ancestors. There also grew a popular conception that this "skull cult" was a "mechanism" for ensuring social solidarity or either perpetuating or challenging an "egalitarian ethic" at a time when the growth of large villages was presenting unprecedented challenges for people in the Near East. These interpretations, as championed by such scholars as Ian Kuijt at University of Notre Dame, place much less emphasis on prehistoric people?s beliefs about death or emotions surrounding the death of loved ones than they do on how ritual practices "function" to "regulate" society. No doubt this is at least in part because of the difficulty, in prehistory, with validating any theories that have to do with emotion or belief. However, the hypothesis of ancestor worship has not gone without challenge. Recently, the French anthropologist Alain Testart has revived a very old idea that Neolithic skull curation had to do with head-hunting. He suggests that a Late Neolithic wall painting from Catalhoyuk in Turkey showing vultures sweeping down on headless corpses should be interpreted, not as a depiction of a mortuary ritual involving exposure of bodies, but as referring to the treatment of defeated enemies. There are numerous ethnographic parallels for the practice of decapitating enemies and keeping their heads or skulls as trophies, of which the Dayak of Borneo are a famous example. In addition, it is worth noting the fairly widespread practice (including at Catalhoyuk) of decorating houses with aurochs horns, wild goat horns and other possible animal trophies that could somewhat mirror the collection of human trophies. That said, there are also difficulties with Testart?s hypothesis. Most notably, evidence for interpersonal violence (such as trauma in the form of broken bones, piercing with projectiles, etc.) in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic is actually extremely rare. That doesn?t mean that they were completely peaceful, but we might expect such evidence to be a lot more prevalent if trophy hunting and inter-community raiding were as culturally important as the ubiquity of skulls suggests. In addition, it is quite clear that the headless skeletons found below Neolithic house floors had their heads removed only after they had been buried for some time, as evidenced both by traces of the pit dug to retrieve the skull and by the fact that the mandible was usually left behind. Michelle Bonogofsky has cast strong doubt on the "venerated elder" part of the ancestor worship hypothesis. As should have been obvious already, not only are the skulls not drawn only from deceased elder males, they include women and children, even quite young children. She has also disproven the hypothesis that teeth were intentionally removed from the skulls of younger individuals to give the illusion of considerable age; in fact, the skulls almost always retain their teeth. Finally, it is interesting to note that the use of human skulls, including plastered ones, among various people of New Guinea, the place that partly inspired Kenyon?s interpretation of the Jericho skulls, was actually much more complicated than simple ancestor veneration. As anthropologist Roger Lohmann has pointed out, despite the importance of ancestors to the Asabano of New Guinea, the curation of skulls and other bones had much more to do with the ongoing relationships of the living to particular deceased individuals. In many cases, this involved the attempt to gain some sort of advantage from the deceased, such as acquiring their particular skill or prowess in some activity. The treatment of bones could also involve their concerns over the potentially malignant activities of ghosts. Although some skulls or other bones could be relics of ancestors, others were thought to have practical uses for the living, including those who were not descendents of the deceased. While we may never know the full meaning of skull treatments in the Near Eastern Neolithic, most likely it was associated with identity, memory, and the particular attributes of the deceased. Cranial relics allowed continuing relationships with the deceased, but we should not be too quick to assume that these were always friendly ones. Ted Banning, University of Toronto	\N

An amorphous substance, it lacks the regular atomic structures found in crystalline forms of silica, the most common being quartz. Precious opal shows a play of colour from the interaction of light with the countless minute spheres of silica of which the opal is made. This unique piece, known as The Dream Cloud, has an interesting history. It is believed to have been carved about 1915, and obtained by Mr. John Junius Morgan of Nyetimber, Chiltington, Sussex, England, from a Russian emigre, apparently as a birthday gift in 1936 (J.J. Morgan was the nephew of J.P. Morgan, Jr., heir to the Morgan fortune). The piece was then given to Miss Margaret Phoir of Fredericton, New Brunswick, a companion of J.P. Morgan's sister; in turn it was given to Miss Phoir's niece, Mrs. John B. MacNeill of Weymouth, Nova Scotia, who in final turn, donated it to the ROM. Mrs. MacNeill is the wife of Dr. John MacNeill, a former director of the Museum. The winged female bust is a personification of The Dream, close to Beaux Arts traditional style with hints of late Art Nouveau. The carver took superb advantage of the brown ironstone matrix in which the opal occurs, by incorporating it into the carving."	\N

The terminations of the crystals in this particular piece are fibrous. Tourmaline is a good example of a pyroelectric mineral: when heated, the crystals develop a positive electric charge at one end and a negative charge at the other. Amazingly, this property was noted 23 centuries ago by the Greek philospher Theophrastus, on crystals that were most likely tourmaline. The mineral is also piezoelectric: crystals become charged when pressure is applied to them."	\N
47210	bari	Evan	Rock Rose	\N	Mineral	\N	\N	\N	\N	1877425	2012-03-25	1458	Owner	"This peculiar mineral specimen consists of approximately 300 clusters of barite crystals, where each platy crystal forms a 'petal' in a rose-like cluster. These barite 'roses' are also called 'rock roses' and 'desert roses'. Minerals form in various ways: some crystallize from molten rock (magma), some are changed (metamorphosed) into new ones by the tremendous heat and pressure deep in the Earth. Others are created by chemical alteration of pre-existing minerals, and yet others like this barite crystallize from water solutions that are saturated with the right elements. In the case of the barite rock roses, the groundwater in red sandstone about one to two meters below the surface was saturated with barium and sulfate. Barite crystallized from this solution, enveloping the red-stained quartz grains of the sandstone as it grew. Many barite roses have weathered out from the rock and can be found loose in the overlying soil. Barite roses are commonly recovered as single clusters. However, in 1995, the spectacular large group of crystals now in the ROM's collection was discovered near Noble, a small town in Oklahoma. It took three weeks to excavate the specimen and it was so large and dirty that it was first cleaned by taking it through a car wash! These roses have inspired legends: one commemorates the forcible relocation of the Cherokee from Georgia to Oklahoma, along the Trail of Tears; the tears they shed turned into roses. The barite rock rose was declared the State rock of Oklahoma."	\N

Libyan Desert Glass is intriguing material, in appearance, in chemical compostion and in its occurrence; a number of theories have been proposed to account for its high silica composition (95 to 99% silica) and its widespread distribution in the Sahara Desert in southwestern Egypt. (This area is also historically known as the Libyan Desert, for which the glass was named, even though the occurrences are in modern Egypt.) In recent years, numerous impact sites have been identified in the Desert, one of them being 30 km in diameter. Their discovery bolsters the impact origin theory, which argues that Desert Glass is the product of intense heating of quartz-rich sands or sandstones during one or more impact events. Lechatelierite is a scientific term given to this naturally occurring fused quartz; it had cooled quickly into a glass, and since glass lacks the regular crystalline structure of minerals it is technically not a mineral, but a rock. (Other examples of rocks that aren't made of minerals are coal, and obsidian which is a volcanic glass.)"	\N

In 1973, a large pegmatite 'pipe' was exposed in the 'floor' of the quarry at Mont-Saint Hilaire and yielded hundreds of superb serandite crystals. Among them was this enormous twinned crystal, which is arguably the world's best specimen of the species; certainly, it has an iconic status among collectors.

Originally a tonalite in composition, it was subjected to a period of high temperatures and pressures which resulted in a layering referred to as ""gneissosity"". Tonalites are similar to the Acasta gneiss occur throughout the rock record, which means that some of the familiar mineral and rock-forming processes operating today began very early in Earth's history."	\N

The silicate was the more rare of the two, and was named hemimorphite because of the hemimorph development of its crystals. This unusual form, which is typical of only a few minerals, means that the crystals are terminated by dissimilar faces. Hemimorphite most commonly forms crystalline crusts and layers, also massive, granular, rounded and reniform aggregates, concentrically striated, or finely needle-shaped, fibrous or stalactitic, and rarely fan-shaped clusters of crystals. This specific specimen in blue in colour and all visible ends on it are very blunt. It is a small sample, and is fairly round in shape. The crystals protrude from a rock."	\N

Instead of figures of a ruler or deity, verses from the sacred book, the Qur'an, are inscribed on the front and back of coins. On the front of this gold coin (dinar) the central belief in the role of Muhammad as the Prophet is invoked: ""Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah."" This is followed by the name of the Caliph in Baghdad, al-Mutawakkil (ruled AD 847-861). On the reverse is the credo: ""There is no God but Allah alone; He has no partner."" Here follows the name of the Caliph's son, al-Mu`tazz (ruled AD 866-869). The mint and date are recorded in the border inscriptions: Misr (old Cairo), 243 Hijra (equivalent to AD 857-858). Islamic coins can be very difficult to read, especially the older ones which are written in the Kufic style of script. This angular form of Arabic script was favoured for monumental inscriptions and early Qur`ans, but gave way to the more legible cursive scripts in the twelfth century AD. Coins were weighed to ensure that they maintained their value. Strict rules governed the marketplace. Silver and copper coins were also in circulation, but many transactions took the form of paper or verbal agreement. Wide trading networks, often based on kinship or ethnic groups, permitted a brisk exchange of goods between the eastern and the western regions of the Islamic world. This area also served as a conduit for goods from the Far East and Southeast Asia to reach European markets."	\N

Seals are carved with a design in reverse. When pressed into or rolled over a material such as soft clay, they leave an impression in relief. A hole was drilled through the centre of seal-stones to allow them to be carried easily on a string. The act of sealing marked ownership. Introduced about the same time as the development of writing (about 3200 BC), cylinder seals were commonly rolled over inscribed tablets to add a signature and an official status to the transaction recorded on the tablet. Soft stones such as serpentine were popular because they were easy to carve. A common theme on these seals is the figure of a supreme god approached by worshippers who are escorted by a minor god. Here the god Shamash holds a pair of maces and appears with the sun's rays streaming from his shoulders; he is approached by a worshipper who is followed by a god escorting tribute bearers."	\N

Such jewels were often given as gifts of political allegiance. This piece of jewellery is finely crafted from gold, diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. It combines several important motifs into its unique design. The large central ruby is surrounded by diamonds in a flower shape. Two mythical creatures, called makaras, flank this central flower. The makara is a hybrid crocodile-elephant-fish, symbolizing auspiciousness, fertility and the primal source of life. Two emerald peacocks, symbols of royalty, rest below the makaras with their heads down. From the central flower, a ruby and diamond plume extends upwards, a form originally reserved for the exclusive adornment of the emperor. Seven raw polished emerald pendants hang from the base and plume. Precious gemstones are one of the most sought-after products of the South Asian subcontinent. India was the world's only source of diamonds until the late nineteenth century and the treasuries of kings were full of sumptuous jewels. Gemstones were not cut down into crystal forms as today and were admired more for their size and color. This turban jewel is both impressive and playful, and betrays the genius of Indian jewellers. It was made using the distinctly Indian technique kundan, by which pure gold foil is joined to gemstones through pressure alone, forming a molecular bond even at room temperature. This technique was perfected in the eighteenth century in the Rajput and Mughal courts of northern India. While gems like this would have been worn by Hindu, Muslim and Sikh nobility, the makaras indicate it was likely made in a Hindu court. However, the cultural synthesis between the wealthy nobility of north India was so complex that by the eighteenth century even this piece may have been gifted to other courts as well."	\N

The habit of snuff taking immediately became popular at court and miniature decorative bottles were specially designed to hold small quantities. As the practice spread beyond the court, the demand for snuff bottles grew, fashioned from almost any material that could be formed in the shape of a bottle.

The head is gently rounded in the cheeks and chin and supports long, gently waving hair flowing back from the center of the forehead. The Buddha?s gently arched eyebrows and long straight nose give him a noble, refined air. His eyes are nearly closed in meditation. The Buddha is shown with his requisite marks of enlightenment. The mound at top of his head, the ushnisha, signifies the Buddha?s omniscience. His halo, now missing but indicated by the flat break at the back of the head, symbolizes the Buddha?s enlightened status. His urna, the tuft of hair in the middle of the forehead, is another auspicious mark of a fully enlightened being. His elongated earlobes, where the heavy earrings of a prince once were, are a reminder of the Buddha?s renunciation. The Buddha was born as an Indian prince in the fifth century BC, but renounced his kingdom to seek truth through spiritual practice and meditation. After realizing that to end suffering one must detach from the material pleasures of the world, he taught others the way. His teachings spread throughout Asia, and are the basis of the Buddhist religion and philosophy. The Gandhara region in modern-day Pakistan and Afghanistan is famous for Buddhist art produced from the first to fourth centuries AD. Considered part of the Kushan Empire, the region was a central crossroads for trade, particularly along the silk routes linking Asia to the West. The unique and prolific artistic tradition of the area provided the first images of the Buddha in human form. Gandhara sculpture combines Indian iconography with Greek, Roman and Parthian stylistic features. The absorption and reinvention of styles is a key feature of Gandharan art. The figure colour is grey.	\N

The image shows the one real masterpiece-a weapon presented to the Museum in the 1920s by the late Dr. Sigmund Samuel, and one of the finest Viking period weapds preserved in any public collection in North America. Used in battle, the weapd is nevertheless beautifully designed, with the purity of form and balance of line and proportion associated in our own era with the best abstract sculptures. This type of blade first appeared in Europe around 900 AD and was equally effective for cutting and thrusting. The hilt is decorated with copper inlay; the decoration is completely subordinate to the design and balance of the hilt itself. The precision of detail and the sheer elegance of the inlay in the form of miniscule strands of metal filament rivals the finest examples of goldsmiths' work of the same period. The inscription on the blade is indecipherable, but similar examples often consist of the name of the blade smith or religious inscriptions. The weapd was dredged from the Thames River at Vauxhall in London, England. It was possibly carried here aboard the ship of Viking raiders. This weapd type was widely used in Europe, and similar examples have been found in Scandinavia, Britain, and in rivers along the western coasts of France."	\N

Weapons like these were finely decorated, in this case with gold. The strong damascene steel is decorated using the koftghari technique whereby tiny incisions are made in steel into which gold is hammered. The result is fine gold decoration applied by pressure alone. This katar has gold floral designs on the handle and a golden elephant's head near the blade. Elephants were symbols of nobility and were common in courtly life. The triangular blade is attached to a hilt composed with two straight uprights to protect the hand and wrist, with crossbars between. Katars were designed to pierce armour, while also providing protection to the hand and wrist. However, they were often worn in the sashes of nobility, for whom they were more decorative than useful. The men of the court wore ornate weapons as jewellery. Lighter in weight and with a less thick blade than most, this katar was likely designed to be impressive at court. Its basic form is unique to India and was especially popular in Mughal and Rajput courts. Because of an Arabic inscription on the side of the cross bars, we can assign this piece to the Mughal courts.

It is cited in a 1558 inventory from Wilton House in Wiltshire. Composed of overlapping horizontal lames of steel held together by internal leather straps and sliding rivets, the breastplate and backplate are of a type known as an ""anime."" Influenced by Italian design, animes played an important part in armour designed by Kirkener between 1550 and 1560. The ROM's anime is one of only three of those made at Greenwich that survive in public collections. Typically Kirkener's animes formed the core parts of armour ""garnitures,"" with interchangeable parts added or subtracted for different purposes. The Pembroke armour in the ROM would have formed the main part of what was known as a ""small garniture,"" which could be made up for infantry, and for light or heavy cavalry use. The ROM's anime of the Earl of Pembroke shows affinities with fashionable dress of the 1550s. It has the same shaped waistline and silhouette of the civilian jacket or doublet.

A closed lotus bud surmounts the temple roof, signifying cosmic renewal and purity. While the conch shell is usually an attribute of the Hindu preserver god Vishnu, this one seems to be associated with Shiva, the god of destruction. The two carved figures flanking the lotus bud are associated with Shiva worship. To the left sits the bull Nandi, Shiva?s faithful companion who symbolizes moral and religious duty. To the right is a Shiva Linga, an abstract phallic-shaped form of the God that symbolizes the creative aspect of his cosmic power. The term shankha (shell) applies to conches used as ornaments, amulets, vessels or trumpets. Since both ends are cut on this example, it was likely used as a trumpet in Hindu ceremonies dedicated to Shiva. The shankha?s sound is said to symbolize the transience of the universe, and have the ability to avert disasters and destroy ignorance. The shankha also symbolizes endless space.	\N

Their Stone Age origins have been sought in such practical devices as a circular mace head, the flywheel of a drill, and the discoidal whorl of a hand spindle. Cutting through the speculation, one authority has boldly referred to the bi and cong as 'the first freely invented forms in Chinese jade carving.' Perhaps from the beginning the hi disc was both ornament and symbol. We know from archaeological remains that it (or a variant of it) was worn as a bracelet in Neolithic times, and as a fastening device in Zhou. It was certainly both ornamental and symbolic as inlay in Han lacquered wood coffins and as pendant in Han reliefs. We know from literary reference that it was a treasured and fought-over medium of exchange, and that it was involved in sacrifice to the spirits of mountains and rivers as well as in the state homage ritual to Heaven, Earth, and the Four Directions. In short, the hi had multiple uses over time and space, of both mundane and powerfully symbolic kinds. Discs of this particular kind were buried with dead princes, as we know from reports of the spectacular royal burials at Man Cheng near Beijing. No fewer than twenty-three hi of this type were found in the two now-famous jade suit burials of the second century BC. They were found inside the coffins, and some had been cut to form the arc-shaped jades for the hands, or for inlay into the opulent headrests for the jade-encased heads of the prince or princess. The most elegant jade hi in these burials is different in style from that pictured here. This one, and some plainer discs from the princely burials, might have been heirlooms or imports kept expressly for burial rather than as the most treasured possessions of the moment. The design of spirals bordered with a 'mask-and-dragon' band, the same on both sides of the disc, points to the late third or earlier second century BC.	\N

In the vertical type of headdress, this supernatural being is a stylized combination of antelope horns, aardvark body and the textured skin of a pangolin. The movements of the masquerade recall the high, impulsive leaps of the frisking antelopes and are meant to bring to life the farming (ci) wild animal (wara) who taught mankind how to cultivate the earth. While Ci wara society is composed of both men and women, emphasizing the necessary gender equilibrium in the reproduction of society, masks are worn exclusively by young men.

Morris had brought the hide, which had been used as a sleigh robe, from Toronto. Traditionally, such a painting served as a pictograph record of a warrior's deeds, and wearing it as a robe announced his elevated status to the community. The figures on the Running Rabbit robe are colour-coded: the Blackfoot in blue, the enemy Cree in red, and the enemy Crow in yellow. It was probably Running Rabbit's son, White Man, who drew the more realistic looking bear and buffalo vignettes around the perimeter of the robe, and perhaps the more central figure of the archer. Morris recorded the execution of the painting in a series of photographs. One shows Running Rabbit explaining the events on the robe to a group of Blackfoot dignitaries, while his son Houghton writes down the stories in English for the collector.	\N

Nkisi is a receptacle of powerful forces from the otherworld that were invoked by a ritual specialist (nganga) to protect individuals and communities, to punish enemies and evil doers and to resolve problems and conflicts. The nails and blades driven through the body of the figure are the means through which its power was activated, and the many embedded in this figure are a clear sign of a very active career. In the first decades of the 1900s, due to the expansion of Christian missions and the development of local prophetic churches of Christian inspiration many power figures were destroyed, deactivated and sold to western collectors.	\N
